visEvents Network visualization events

#### Description
Network visualization events. For full documentation, have a look at visDocumentation. Use
type = "once" to set an event listener only once, and type = "off" to disable all the related
events.
#### Usage
<pre><code>
visEvents(graph, type = "on", click = NULL, doubleClick = NULL,
oncontext = NULL, hold = NULL, release = NULL, select = NULL,
selectNode = NULL, selectEdge = NULL, deselectNode = NULL,
deselectEdge = NULL, dragStart = NULL, dragging = NULL,
dragEnd = NULL, hoverNode = NULL, blurNode = NULL, hoverEdge = NULL,
blurEdge = NULL, zoom = NULL, showPopup = NULL, hidePopup = NULL,
startStabilizing = NULL, stabilizationProgress = NULL,
stabilizationIterationsDone = NULL, stabilized = NULL, resize = NULL,
initRedraw = NULL, beforeDrawing = NULL, afterDrawing = NULL,
animationFinished = NULL)
</code></pre>
#### Arguments
* ``graph`` : a visNetwork object
* ``type`` :   Character. "on" (Default) to full listener, "once" to set an event listener only
once, or "off" to disable a listener.
click : Fired when the user clicks the mouse or taps on a touchscreen device.
doubleClick : Fired when the user double clicks the mouse or double taps on a touchscreen
device. Since a double click is in fact 2 clicks, 2 click events are fired, followed
by a double click event. If you do not want to use the click events if a double
click event is fired, just check the time between click events before processing
them.
oncontext : Fired when the user click on the canvas with the right mouse button. The right
mouse button does not select by default. You can use the method getNodeAt to
select the node if you want.
hold : Fired when the user clicks and holds the mouse or taps and holds on a touchscreen
device. A click event is also fired in this case.
* ``release`` :   Fired after drawing on the canvas has been completed. Can be used to draw on
top of the network.
select : Fired when the selection has changed by user action. This means a node or
edge has been selected, added to the selection or deselected. All select events
are only triggered on click and hold.
selectNode : Fired when a node has been selected by the user.
selectEdge : Fired when a edge has been selected by the user.
deselectNode : Fired when a node (or nodes) has (or have) been deselected by the user. The
previous selection is the list of nodes and edges that were selected before the
last user event.
18 visEvents
deselectEdge : Fired when a edge (or edges) has (or have) been deselected by the user. The
previous selection is the list of nodes and edges that were selected before the
last user event.
dragStart : Fired when starting a drag.
dragging : Fired when dragging node(s) or the view.
dragEnd : Fired when the drag has finished.
hoverNode : Fired interaction:hover:true and the mouse hovers over a node.
blurNode : Fired interaction:hover:true and the mouse moved away from a node it was
hovering over before.
hoverEdge : Fired interaction:hover:true and the mouse hovers over a edge
blurEdge : Fired interaction:hover:true and the mouse moved away from a edge it was
hovering over before.
zoom : Fired when the user zooms in or out. The properties tell you which direction
the zoom is in. The scale is a number greater than 0, which is the same that you
get with network.getScale().
showPopup : Fired when the popup (tooltip) is shown.
hidePopup : Fired when the popup (tooltip) is hidden.
startStabilizing
: Fired when stabilization starts. This is also the case when you drag a node
and the physics simulation restarts to stabilize again. Stabilization does not
neccesarily imply âwithout showingâ.
stabilizationProgress
: Fired when a multiple of the updateInterval number of iterations is reached.
This only occurs in the âhiddenâ stabilization. Passes an object with properties
structured as:
stabilizationIterationsDone
: Fired when the âhiddenâ stabilization finishes. This does not necessarily mean
the network is stabilized; it could also mean that the amount of iterations defined
in the options has been reached.
stabilized : Fired when the network has stabilized or when the stopSimulation() has been
called. The amount of iterations it took could be used to tweak the maximum
amount of iterations needed to stabilize the network.
resize : Fired when the size of the canvas has been resized, either by a redraw call
when the container div has changed in size, a setSize() call with new values or a
setOptions() with new width and/or height values.
initRedraw : Fired before the redrawing begins. The simulation step has completed at this
point. Can be used to move custom elements before starting drawing the new
frame.
beforeDrawing : Fired after the canvas has been cleared, scaled and translated to the viewing
position but before all edges and nodes are drawn. Can be used to draw behind
the network.
afterDrawing : Fired after drawing on the canvas has been completed. Can be used to draw on
top of the network.
animationFinished
: Fired when an animation is finished.

```{r}
nodes <- data.frame(id = 1:3)
edges <- data.frame(from = c(1,2), to = c(1,3))
visNetwork(nodes, edges) %>%
visEvents(select = "function(properties) {
alert('selected nodes: ' + properties.nodes);}",
dragEnd = "function(properties) {
alert('finish to drag');}")
# set one
visNetwork(nodes, edges) %>%
visEvents(type = "once", select = "function() {
alert('first selection');}") %>%
visEvents(select = "function(properties) {
alert('selected nodes: ' + properties.nodes);}",
dragEnd = "function(properties) {
alert('finish to drag');}")
# use this to get the network
visNetwork(nodes, edges) %>%
visEvents(type = "once", startStabilizing = "function() {
this.moveTo({scale:0.1})}") %>%
visPhysics(stabilization = FALSE)
# shift+click, .....
visNetwork(nodes, edges) %>%
visEvents(click = "function(e) {
if(e.event.srcEvent.shiftKey){
alert('shift+click event')
} else if(e.event.srcEvent.ctrlKey){
alert('ctrl+click event')
}else if(e.event.srcEvent.altKey){
alert('alt+click event')
} else {
alert('click event')
}
}")
