visPhysics
#### Description
Network visualization Physics options. For full documentation, have a look at visDocumentation.
#### Usage
<pre><code>
visPhysics(graph, solver = NULL, maxVelocity = NULL, minVelocity = NULL,
timestep = NULL, barnesHut = NULL, forceAtlas2Based = NULL,
repulsion = NULL, hierarchicalRepulsion = NULL, stabilization = NULL,
adaptiveTimestep = NULL, enabled = NULL)
</code></pre>
#### Arguments
* ``graph`` : a visNetwork object
* solver : String. Default to âbarnesHutâ. You can select your own solver. Possible
* options: âbarnesHutâ, ârepulsionâ, âhierarchicalRepulsionâ, âforceAtlas2Basedâ.
When setting the hierarchical layout, the hierarchical repulsion solver is automaticaly
selected, regardless of what you fill in here.
* maxVelocity : Number. Default to 50. The physics module limits the maximum velocity of
the nodes to increase the time to stabilization. This is the maximium value.
* minVelocity : Number. Default to 0.1. Once the minimum velocity is reached for all nodes,
we assume the network has been stabilized and the simulation stops.
* timestep : Number. Default to 0.5. The physics simulation is discrete. This means we
take a step in time, calculate the forces, move the nodes and take another step.
If you increase this number the steps will be too large and the network can get
unstable. If you see a lot of jittery movement in the network, you may want to
reduce this value a little.
barnesHut, named list of options
-  "gravitationalConstant" : Number. Default to -2000. Gravity attracts. We
like repulsion. So the value is negative. If you want the repulsion to be
stronger, decrease the value (so -10000, -50000).
-  "centralGravity" : Number. Default to 0.3. There is a central gravity attractor
to pull the entire network back to the center.
-  "springLength" : Number. Default to 95. The edges are modelled as
springs. This springLength here is the the rest length of the spring.
-  "springConstant" : Number. Default to 0.04. This is how âsturdyâ the
springs are. Higher values mean stronger springs.
-  "damping" : Number. Default to 0.09. Accepted range: [0 .. 1]. The damping
factor is how much of the velocity from the previous physics simulation
iteration carries over to the next iteration.
-  "avoidOverlap" : Number. Default to 0. Accepted range: [0 .. 1]. When
larger than 0, the size of the node is taken into account. The distance will be
calculated from the radius of the encompassing circle of the node for both
the gravity model. Value 1 is maximum overlap avoidance.
forceAtlas2Based,
named list of options
visPhysics 75
-  "gravitationalConstant" : Number. Default to -50. Gravity attracts. We like
repulsion. So the value is negative. If you want the repulsion to be stronger,
decrease the value (so -10000, -50000).
-  "centralGravity" : Number. Default to 0.01. There is a central gravity
attractor to pull the entire network back to the center.
-  "springLength" : Number. Default to 100. The edges are modelled as
springs. This springLength here is the the rest length of the spring.
-  "springConstant" : Number. Default to 0.08. This is how âsturdyâ the
springs are. Higher values mean stronger springs.
-  "damping" : Number. Default to 0.4. Accepted range: [0 .. 1]. The damping
factor is how much of the velocity from the previous physics simulation
iteration carries over to the next iteration.
-  "avoidOverlap" : Number. Default to 0. Accepted range: [0 .. 1]. When
larger than 0, the size of the node is taken into account. The distance will be
calculated from the radius of the encompassing circle of the node for both
the gravity model. Value 1 is maximum overlap avoidance.
repulsion, named list of options
-  "nodeDistance" : Number. Default to 100. This is the range of influence
for the repulsion.
-  "centralGravity" : Number. Default to 0.2. There is a central gravity attractor
to pull the entire network back to the center.
-  "springLength" : Number. Default to 200. The edges are modelled as
springs. This springLength here is the the rest length of the spring.
-  "springConstant" : Number. Default to 0.05. This is how âsturdyâ the
springs are. Higher values mean stronger springs.
-  "damping" : Number. Default to 0.09. Accepted range: [0 .. 1]. The damping
factor is how much of the velocity from the previous physics simulation
iteration carries over to the next iteration.
hierarchicalRepulsion,
named list of options
-  "nodeDistance" : Number. Default to 120. This is the range of influence
for the repulsion.
-  "centralGravity" : Number. Default to 0.0. There is a central gravity attractor
to pull the entire network back to the center.
-  "springLength" : Number. Default to 100. The edges are modelled as
springs. This springLength here is the the rest length of the spring.
-  "springConstant" : Number. Default to 0.01. This is how âsturdyâ the
springs are. Higher values mean stronger springs.
-  "damping" : Number. Default to 0.09. Accepted range: [0 .. 1]. The damping
factor is how much of the velocity from the previous physics simulation
iteration carries over to the next iteration.
stabilization,
Just a boolean, or a named list of options
-  "enabled" : Boolean. Default to true. Toggle the stabilization. This is an
optional property. If undefined, it is automatically set to true when any of
the properties of this object are defined.
76 visPhysics
-  "iterations" : Number. Default to 1000. The physics module tries to stabilize
the network on load up til a maximum number of iterations defined
here. If the network stabilized with less, you are finished before the maximum
number.
-  "updateInterval" : Number. Default to 50. When stabilizing, the DOM can freeze. You can chop the stabilization up into pieces to show a loading
bar for instance. The interval determines after how many iterations the stabilizationProgress event is triggered.
-  "onlyDynamicEdges" : Boolean. Default to false. If you have predefined the position of all nodes and only want to stabilize the dynamic smooth
edges, set this to true. It freezes all nodes except the invisible dynamic smooth curve support nodes. If you want the visible nodes to move and
stabilize, do not use this.
-  "fit" : Boolean. Default to true. Toggle whether or not you want the view
to zoom to fit all nodes when the stabilization is finished.
adaptiveTimestep
: Boolean. Default to true. If this is enabled, the timestep will intelligently be adapted (only during the stabilization stage if stabilization is enabled!) to greatly
decrease stabilization times. The timestep configured above is taken as the minimum
timestep. This can be further improved by using the improvedLayout
algorithm.
enabled : Boolean. Default to true. Toggle the physics system on or off. This property is
optional. If you define any of the options below and enabled is undefined, this
will be set to true.
